&YHelp Topic&O: &BPink Barrier
&YRelated Topics&O: &BEnergy Barrier, Blue Barrier

&CBuus are a very unique race which have the ability to form a
barrier to protect themselves from both melee and ki. The pink
barrier is formed when a buu concentrates a vast amount of ki
and forms a protective shield around its body. Like all new
skills it requires an amount of energy to keep the barrier going
so remember to use caution.

56 ''IMM AUTH'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 49-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

52 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

parts. Yet they still maintain the appearance of a human. Androids are
made artificially by a mad scientist in the Red Ribbon Army. These super
machines often have minds of their own, though some merely have basic
programming. Most of them are programmed to destroy a certain target at
any cost. They possess the ability to draw power from a target. Being made
with advanced technology, they may analyze a target far more accurately
than a scouter. Also, they may take technological components and install
them, upgrading or healing their body.

&CSome races have learned to protect themselves by creating a thin, but
powerful sheet of energy. This energy field, or 'barrier' as it is
called, is capable of reducing the damage from energy attacks, or even
physical blows. Those who see a likely opponent surrounded by a
shimmering energy barrier would be wise to approach cautiously, as
they will likely survive a much larger attack than you give them
credit for.

&CCreated by many scientists, the Blue Barrier Chip is a specially
designed chip which allows an android to use some of it's own
energy to create a barrier. This barrier however does not block
physical attacks, instead this barrier blocks energy attacks,
which would be very fatal to the android. As powerful as it
may seem, this BB chip draws energy from the androids body in
order to be sustained. The whereabouts of this special chip
is not entirely know but some droids have been coming back from
the lab with an unusual blue glow.

&CBiodroids are biologically engineered androids. They are made of cells of a
large variety of races. This makes it possible that they have the skills
of many races combined. Biodroids are known for their unusual way of
training.  When a bioandroid kills someone who is close to his/her own pl,
or higher they have the ability to absorb biomass from the victim. When a
biodroid gathered enough biomass they transform to another stage. Unlike
other races biodroids lose half powerlevel when they die. However they do
lose a part of their gathered biomass. When you die too often you can go
back a stage, however you will lose the higher mod that the stage gave
until you get enough biomass again.

bodies allow them to assimilate anything they wish to absorb into their
DNA, making them extremely versatile and dangerous opponents. It's said
that Buus still retain some of the abilities of the original Buu, or those
he stole anyway. They feed off the lifeforce in matter, known to them as
kili, which seems to power and trigger their transformations. Strangely
enough, the way in which they evolve is molded by their personalities,
a trait never seen on a race before.

&RSyntax&r: &CTrain Chikara#
 
&CChikara is Japanese, meaning force, strength, energy, and might.    
 
 In terms of the MUD, Chikara is the ability to push your body to new
limits, so that you can channel more ki, control your mind with greater
precision, and bring yourself into harmony with the universe. Chikara will
allow you to surpass the initial powerlevel limits of five million.
However, Chikara does not only require pure strength and conditioning, it
also requires a well developed mind. Therefore only those warriors that
are truely powerful and wise will be able to train Chikara to its full
potential.
 
 Chikara is only taught by special teachers, and trained only at certain
places. The first few Chikaras can be learned at the the basic fighter
schools. Getting there requires certain tests of abilities, which upon
completion  will one be able to elevate themselves to greater power. To 
raise your knowledge of chikara you must first practice it at a trainer 
who infuses the knowledge into you.

49 DAMPLUS~
.
For those unsure of what damplus is, it is part of the damage
equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)
This "damplus" is always added, whether or not the mob is barehanded or
wielding a weapon.   This is basically the mob's damroll.

   If you die you will be sent to the next dimension, also known as
the Afterlife. In the Afterlife, you can reincarnate and then find your way
back to the normal world. Reincarnating is not a party though, it will
cost 8% of your base powerlevel. So try not to get killed.
 
Biodroids will suffer an 8% loss of their gathered Biomass upon reincarnation.
 
&WDeath is now at -5 lifeforce and near death is at -4 lifeforce.

  |    Most of the extensive debugging and coding of Realms of Despair   |
  |    was done by Thoric in what little spare time he could set aside.  |
  |                                                                      |

&RSyntax&r:&C Style Defensive
 
&RUsage&r:&C Style defensive will change your stance. Changing your stance
to defensive will make you hit softer, but take less damage. Every time a
person attacks you, you will lose KI.
 
~

58 DELAY~
Syntax: delay <victim> <rounds>
 
This command will allow an immortal to "pause" a player. All commands
received by the mud from that player will be delayed by the number of
round determined by the delaying immortal. After the rounds have
elapsed, anything input by the victim during the delay will take affect
on the mud.
NOTE: Mobiles cannot be delayed.
~

58 DENY DISCONNECT FREEZE~
Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>
Syntax: freeze     <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY persists past reboots and crashes and can only be undone by either loading
up the character and doing a 'mset <character name> flags deny', or by editing
the player file offline.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

1 DESCRIPTION BIO~
&YHelp Topic&O: &BDescription/Bio
&YRelated Topics&O:&B RP

&CSyntax: description
        bio

The DESCRIPTION command puts you into an editor to edit your long character
description (what people see when they look at you).
The BIO command puts you into an editor to edit your personal bio: what
people see when they check WHOIS on you.
 
An Immortal can request you change your description or bio if it contains
inappropriate material.  Do not use profanity, racial slurs, sexual comments,
other players names (without their permission), or off-color remarks.  Refusal
to change your bio, description, or title on Immortal request is grounds for
loss of character privileges.

~

65 DESTROY~
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
     SYNTAX:  destroy <target>
 
DESCRIPTION: The DESTROY command does exactly as it suggests: 
             destroys player files. Caution, the command 
             destroys the pfile in use, leaving only the 
             backup of the pfile, if there is one.

To make the special SMAUG spells possible, special dice formula handling
had to be coded in.  (At least to make it nice).  This dice formula code
supports full BEDMAS expressions ( ) ^^ / * + -, plus extra mud related
operators and variables:

0 DIKU~
SMAUG was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)

          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.

&RSyntax: &CDisk - Creates a whirling energy attack

&CMore than a few races have realized the usefulness of being able to
create an energy attack capable of cutting through objects, as well
as people. As with most energy attacks, there are many variations
on this, and as such, there is no 'correct' way to perform it. The
most often seen technique involves placing your flat palm above you,
or to the side, creating the whirling, razor-sharp disk of energy
there. The obvious reason for this is to prevent cutting yourself
with your own disk.

49 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

49 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.

63 FLOODFILL~
Syntax: mapedit fill <sectortype>
Syntax: mapedit undo

Floodfilling is the process of changing all of the terrain within a contained
section of the map into another kind of terrain. It operates much the same way
as Windows Paint, or any other floodfill function in a graphics editor would.

You will first need to use the mapedit command to walk an outline on the map
in the shape you'd like it to be. Once you've done this, turn off your mapedit
flag and then step to the inside of the area you've just surrounded ( or to
the outside if you want to fill what's on the outside instead ).
Then, type: mapedit fill <sectortype> where sectortype is any sector in the
sectortypes list, except exits. The floodfill function will the proceed to 
change everything inside the boundry from what your standing on, into what you 
want it to be.

So if your standing on oceans, and you want to fill grassland inside the boundry,
type: mapedit fill grassland. That will change all the oceans into grasslands.

Note that you CANNOT specify a terrain type to fill in that is the same as what
you are standing on. To force the code to allow for that would create an infinite
loop, and so the fill operation will just fail instead.

If for some reason you need to undo what you've just filled in, simply type:
'mapedit undo' and your last floodfill will be reversed.

1 FLY FLIGHT~
&YHelp Topics: &BFLY FLIGHT
&YRelated Topics: &BSKILLS


&CThe primary use of flight in the DBZ universe is to gain a tactical
advantage during combat, generally a 10% boost to combat skills,
although it is sometimes used to quickly reach a destination when
it is under attack very useful in roleplaying scenarios. To fly, simply
type 'fly'.  It is important to note that flying can be somewhat detrimental
to ones health as it does cost some life force to take off. 
To land, simply type 'fly' again.

Note: If you are to fight/spar, and you wish to attack, you must also be flying if 
your opponent is flying as well. You may attack if you are flying, whether or not
your opponent is or is not flying.

*NOTE* 
Area files have backups that record the file as it was prior to foldarea.
If you folda something and realize there's a mistake, and you've only
folded it once -- don't do anything else.  Post a note or find Blodkai.
 
Do not fold changes into non-quest areas that are quest related.  If you
must do this, write a note or ensure it's changed back.

             gfighting <low> <high>
             gfighting <low> <high> mobs
 
DESCRIPTION: The GFIGHTING command does a global search 
             for the fighting targets specified, where 
             <low> <high> indicates the target's level.
 
    EXAMPLE: gfighting 1 5 would display a list of PCs 
             levels one through five that are fighting, 
             who they are fighting and their level, what 
             vnum/room name they are fighting in, and the 
             name of the area they are fighting in. By 
             adding the 'mobs' variable, the command 
             would display the same information for mobs 
             of the levels specified.

51 GOTO~
Syntax: goto map <mapname> [x] [y]
Syntax: goto <location>

If you are going to an overland map, type 'goto map <mapname> [x] [y]'
where mapname is the name you gave to the target map, x and y are the
target coordinates on that map. The x and y coordinates can be left out,
in which case you will be sent to the geographical center of that overland
map.

You can also specify a location. This location can be the vnum of a room,
a name of a mob, or a name of an object. 

If the location is a mob or object, you will be transported directly to
it weather it is in a normal room or on the overland.

If the location is a vnum, does not yet exist, you have an area assigned,
and the vnum is within your range, it will be created with default data 
so that the room can then be edited with the 'redit' command.
 
You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

You may also "GOTO pk" to go to the site of the most recent illegal pkill.

&YHelp Topic&O: &BGRAVITY
&YRelated Topics&O: &BPL, DEATH    
 
&RSyntax: &CGravset <Level> 
        Train Gravity   
 
 Gravity Training is a system used by fighters who are not satisfied with
the powerlevel they are gaining by fighting mobs alone.  Some start as
early as 10,000 pl while others wait till 100,000 pl.  It is recommended to
train at approximately 1 level for every 10,000 pl you have.  Training at
higher levels may be lethal as your body is not strong enough to take the
force. There will be no reimbursements for death due to mistyping
levels, so double check them.  The amount of power you gain is dependent
upon your powerlevel, the level trained on, and how long you've trained at
said level.   
 
A set of four numbers appear when you attempt this training. They are:
Current gravity level, Successes, Series, Needed. Current gravity is self
explanatory. 'Success' is the number of time total you have trained under
current gravity since your last pl gain. 'Series' is the number of times
in a row you have trained successfully.  Needed is the Series number you
need in order to achieve a pl gain. You MUST get your Series equal to
Needed for pl gain. 
 
 Gravity Training is so intense that once you finish with one training
session you will need to wait for 4 minutes before your body is able to
continue training. You will also need to wait 4 minutes after you log onto
the mud before you are able to train. Copyovers do not effect this in any
way.
 
&YMax Gravity Level: &R3,500

and may use the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked,
you will automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).

&C  Half-breeds are not a simple mix of just any two races. They are, more
specifically, half human, and half saiyan. Half-breeds, for the most part,
live on Earth. Like Saiyans, they are born with a monkey tail
 also, like
their Saiyan parents, they have the ability to become a Super Saiyan, as
well as transform into the giant monkey-beasts known as Oozaru, though the
latter is only possible if their tails are still attached during a full
moon. Rumor has it that half-breeds are incapable of attaining as high
of a level of Super Saiyan, though this is hard to prove, since so few
attain such unheard-of power.

54 HEDIT~
Syntax: hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you. The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name> 
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated 
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.

49 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.
 
To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".

of the attack actually fill up the hole in the earth and shoot up
through the crust of the Earth, creating huge holes in the ground.

Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

.  This article presents a research based on video game advertisements. The article also provides a wide variety of statistic results from the research they conducted on 1,054 video game ads.  Studies showed that 42% of American homes own at least one video game console. Due to the fact that boys play video games more often than girls, many games rarely present the female gender. The results showed the advertisement companys narrow minds and their aim toward male consumers, subsequently the female gender was particularly used only as a sexual object. These ads use vivid images of scenes or representations to capture the eye of the average gamer. Even though thats how advertising is supposed to be, game developers dont hesitate to not use the most bloodiest and violent scenes that the game offers. Some other games use the female gender with proportionate body dimensions to promote the game, just like any kind of product on the market. 
   I believe the use of violence, especially guns and blood, and the female body in the advertisements of video games should be kept to a minimum. While there are mature consumers who still play video games for their intense violence and thrill pleasures, there is still a young audience out there that must be taken into account. The article is well documented and the parameters and variables for the research on the ads of magazines were a work of genius. They basically covered every angle about the analysis of the advertisements.

Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up 
when you view the help with the help command.

&C Jack of all trades, master of none. Unlike other MUDs, humans
here have the potential to possibly be as strong as the most powerful
Saiya-Jin. Humans have the innate ability to improve themselves
in a short period of time, resulting in a faster gain of power than
any other race! As if this wasn't enough, if humans push themselves
enough, they are able to achieve a state of being known only as
"super human". In this stage, their power increases by a huge
magnitude, making them a formidable opponent in battle.

&CIcers are a race of mostly evil, arrogant, destructive beings. Upon first
glance, icers appear to be relatively weak, possibly even child-like. But
make no mistake. Icers are among the most feared creatures in the galaxy.
Even the weakest icer possesses the ability to transform itself, boosting
its PL to double what it once was. Furthermore, truly powerful icers are
able to transform to greater forms, boosting their powerlevel to heights
that are unimaginable to the normal person. A powerful icer, transformed,
could easily annihilate an entire planet, reducing it to mere cinders.
Icers are also very technologically advanced. The scouter is based on
their designs, as any icer foot-soldier will tell you.

&YHelp Topic&O: &BICERTAIL
&YRelated Topics&O: &BTAIL ICER


&CSyntax: tail <target> - strike a target with your tail
Icers possess a long, prehensile tail, which, like the saiyan tail, may
be used to grasp, pick up, squeeze, and strike opponents and objects.
Unlike the saiyan tail, the icer tail is smooth and hairless. Like the
rest of their bodies, the tail appears lightly armored especially in
their later forms. Tail length and strength can vary from form to form,
but with training, an icer can learn to increase the strength and length,
making it a formidable weapon.

After practicing the taillength and tailstrength skills, further skill
is gained by typing: TRAIN TAIL<LENGTH/STRENGTH>

The Thresholds for the skills are as follows:

&RSyntax&r:&C Ignore
Ignore [Character]
Ignore Reply/None
 
&RUsage&r:&C Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All
tells, says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out). You will still see their communications through public channels, however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.
 
&RCant ignore Immortals, because it goes through.

~

49 'IMM ECHO'~
Associated help files: echo

Echos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Role-playing should be used rarely, however.
 
Though there is some leeway within these guidelines, some practices
are frowned upon and should be avoided.  Do not use your name in an echo
unless necessary.  Avoid comical phrases or 'cutsey' terms.  Do not use
:) or other symbols/punctuations at all.
 
If any of the above are necessary, there exist a sufficient number of
public channels via which the task can be accomplished while still
reaching a wide audience -  without forcing it onto the screen of
every character in the game.
~

49 'IMM EQUIP~
.                       Equipment Usage
                       ---------------
**  All equipment worn by an immortal must be made from vnum 1222.
**  No stats or affects may be added to vnum 1222.
**  If you need to test your mobs, you may make a weapon with the
    stats needed to test your mob.
~

49 'IMM FORCE'~
Associated help files: force
 
This command allows you to make someone execute a command.  Forcing
someone can often be looked at as high-handed.  Most common use of
force is to make someone do something as you are snooping, to check
problems or bugs, without waiting having to tell the character exactly
what to type.  It is always best to ask the person before you begin
forcing them.  You may also use force to make a player quit, drop,
or read something when you are punishing them.  
 
Force all <command> can be done, but causes excessive lag because it
causes every player lower than you to attempt the command.  This should
be reserved to "force all save" in times of numerous crashes.  You should
never force all to use a channel.
~

49 'IMM FORCECLOSE'~
Associated help files: forceclose
 
This command will force a certain descriptor to close.  To use, you
must first look for the number listed under Desc on the user list.
Then type: forceclose <Desc #>
 
You can use forceclose to knock a trouble player offline, as well as
knock off someone who it stuck online.
~

49 'IMM FREEZE'~
Associated help files: help freeze
 
Syntax: deny         <character>
Syntax: disconnect   <character>
Syntax: freeze       <character>
 
DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.  
Deny is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within
the game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal
a DENY by editing the appropriate player file.
 
DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.
 
FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

49 'IMM GOTO'~
Syntax: goto <name>

This is a reminder to use common courtesy when using such commands
as goto.   Not only is it considered inappropriate to goto higher
level immortals without asking permission, the same could be said
when wanting to visit any player on the mud.  A quick tell requesting
to visit would suffice.  For those of you who frequent headquarters,
either Clans, Guilds or Orders, requesting permission, though not
necessary, is certainly welcome.  Note that if a mortal requests that
you leave their hq, and you have no pressing business, you are obligated
to abide by their wishes.  (This does not apply to high ranking immortals.)

49 'IMM INVIS'~
Associated help files: invis and wizinvis
 
Those Immortals between levels 49 and 54 may invis to level 49 when they
are running or preparing a quest, involved in a building projects that
requires you to be uninterrupted, or you are actively watching a mortal.
At all other times, the Immortal should be visible to all levels of mortals
and Immortals.  Wizinvis is to be used as a tool to assist you in your duties
as an Immortal, it is not a means to spy on others or hide.
 
Immortals of level 55 and above may use wizinvis beyond 49 to work on
projects or monitor another person.  It is mandatory to be visible to all
other immortals whenever reasonably able to do so.  Keep the use of
"Someone" to a minimum on channels.  Exceptions are when you need to answer
a question, make a comment, or pass on some information, but are too busy
to become visible.

49 'IMM RECHO'~
Associated help files: recho
 
Rechos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Recho can be seen by all players in one room.  Do not 
use recho to "scare" mortals.  Recho is seen on logs, be cautious in
using them in social/private situations.

49 'IMM SNOOP'~
Associated help files: snoop

The snoop command is a very valuable tool, when used appropriately.  Snoop
not only allows you to watch another person, but to see the world through
their eyes, helping to track down problems the person may be experiencing.
The reasons for snooping are too varied to mention here, but the reasons
NOT to snoop are easily listed.
 
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
   snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- If a higher level Immortals requests you to stop snooping, do so quickly.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded.
    ** For example, you learn someone is having a mud affair from snoop.
    ** This information has nothing to do with the reason you are snooping
    ** and should not affect your judgement.  It should not be passed on.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

49 IMMAUTH AUTH AUTHORIZE~
Associated help file: Authorize
 
Syntax: authorize <name> <yes|name|no/deny>
 
Authorize is used to allow a new player to start his or her character.
Names must not be offensive or similar to an existing immortal (within a
letter or two).  Names like "Braveheart" are acceptable even though they
are not normally considered "proper" names.  Players are allowed to use
names of mobs ... but not extremely popular mobs.
Use your best judgement when authorizing a name.
 
You may use the abbreviation "a" for authorize and the abbreviation "n" 
for name.  In addition, you only need to type as much of a name to uniquely
identify it.
 
So, for example, if Goixetoika is awaiting authorization,

a                shows pending authorizations
a g              allows the name
a g n            requires player to change name
a g no           denies name and forces player off (offensive name)
~

55 IMMHOST~
Syntax:  immhost add    <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost delete <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost save
Syntax:  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.

&CImmortals have rules. The rules HAVE to be followed. Read below
to, know the rules:
 
&R(Continued From Help Immrules)
 
&Y6&O:&c)&C Comments are to post a mark on a Players Player File. Comments
can range from silencing to helling to getting a bless from an odd reason.
But, everytime, you hell a player, or silence, etc. YOU MUST PUT A MARK
IN THERE PFILE. This helps us to determine who is being bad/good. And is
an easy spot to determine who turns an immortal when we need them.
 
&Y7&O:&c)&C Helling is a SERIOUS punishment. Second Most Harsh. First
being deleted. Helling a player, makes the player become inactive
to their character. If a Player is BOTTING, They GET helled. No
exceptions. DO NOT abuse it, and make sure you add it to Comments.
 
&Y8&O:&c)&C Yes, Mseting is NOT a problem when Mseting your character.
BUT, If you mset a player, IT IS ILLEGAL! Do NOT do it. If you mset
a character for WHATEVER reason(Unless TESTING a Area) is illegal.
This applies with everything on mset.
 
&Y9&O:&c)&C Snooping. Snooping is legal in some ways. First of all
Do NOT abuse it. It is not for Personal Enjoyment. It is to find
out if they are botting, or doing something illegal. If a Immortal
is abusing snoop, they will be deleted. Snooping is only a time
when to accomplish an objective.
 
&Y10&O:&c)&C Creation and Blessgive. Both Most Used Help Files. When
You change/update/create a helpfile. ADD IT TO HELP CREATION. This
will allow us to indicate when the last time a help file was created
or update. Read Help creation for more. Also when you give a bless
to a player, make SURE you add it to Help Blessgive, read Help
Blessgive for more information

&WRules for imm's questing:&G
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no Imm will be multi-playing their imm while they
   are questing.  This includes multi-playing while invis/afk/etc.
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no imm will log off their imm character in order to
   quest.  We don't want the situation arising where everyone logs off and the
   QC imm is stranded running the quest and fielding everything else.
 
 &W*&G You may &CNOT&G quest if you log in with your imm at any time during
   the quest.
 
&WSo when can you quest?&G
 
 &W*&G It's somewhat limiting, but you can quest &CIF&G you happen to be 
   morting when a quest begins, &COR&G if you are given the explicit
   permission of the imm running the quest. &CPlease do not pressure them.&G
 
 
Immortals can apply once a month for a rename scroll or twenty glory.
Phalanx, on behalf of the Quest Council, and Elcid on behalf of the
Symposium are responsible for the distribution of the monthly 'payments.'
To apply for your monthly rename or share of glory, post a note on 1203
stating the month, the form in which you'd like to receive your payment
(scroll/glory), and the mortal's name that will be receiving the payment.

Syntax: ipcompare <name>
        ipcompare <site>

This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.

&CThe maximum kaioken level is 20.
 
Kaioken is a powerful technique invented by the fighting master,
King Kai, though he was unable to perform the technique himself.
It bathes the user in a red and white ki aura and multiplies
their powerlevel by the level of kaioken used.
 
Kaioken has the potential to be a very dangerous skill, not
only to opponents, but to the user as well. Though it is generally
considered safe to use a level of kaioken equal to your powerlevel
in the millions, this is not always the case. As you use higher
and higher levels, the chances increase that the next use of this

1 KI ENERGY~
&YHelp Topic&O: &BKi Energy
&YRelated Topics&O: &BDeath Kiattack Kigain Styles
 
&CEnergy is something basic possessed by all beings, natural or created,
large or small. Energy gives things life, allows them to move, and to
those who have the proper training, allow people to perform tremendous
feats of strength and power.
 
Sometimes referred to as Ki, energy affects all manner of things. When
your energy is high, you have a higher defense, making you less likely
to die. Energy can be drained by certain combat styles, some enemy
abilities, or by using ki attacks. The lower your energy gets, the
lower your defense will get, so be wary.  An energy attack may be useful

&YHelp Topic&O: &BKIATTACK
&YRelated Topics&O: &BKI RACE KITABLE KICHARGE DIRECT

&CEvery race possesses special abilities of one kind or another. Invariably,
there are some that are unique to that race, while there are others that
other races are able to use. There are even a few--such as kick, punch,
and energy ball--that every race in the Galaxy can use, in one form or
another. Ki attacks, when used, drain ki to some small degree. Further
amounts of ki may be pumped into it, to make it hold a &WCHARGE. &CWhen
ready, simply &WDIRECT &Cyour attack at an opponent and pray. It is
important to note that ki attacks, if held for too long without firing
or releasing them, will begin to drain your ki as your body struggles
to hold the attack in existence.

For a complete table of abilities, with indicators of which races
receive which abilities, please check KITABLE for a complete listing.

&C The kyodaika is an old ancient namekian technique used by the
elders to focus their energy in order to increase the size and
strength. This technique could only be used by the specially
trained nameks who were worthy enough and focused enough, the
reason of this was because in order for the strength increase,
the namek would be vulnerable to attack and have lower defense.

1 LAW LAWS~
&YHelp Topic&O: &BLaw
&YHelp Information&O: &BLaws, why they are needed and form of punishment
&YHelp Related Topics&O: &BRules
 
&CTo keep the mud for all to enjoy, it is governed by a set of laws. Most are
simple and common courtesy, but all of which must be followed by both mortals
and immortals to keep the game enjoyable. With any mud, a player's presence
here is a privilege, not a right.
 
The immortals are responsible for enforcing these laws, and their choices
of punishments may vary on what the crime was. If you feel an immortal
has treated you unfairly, you may ask an immortal of a higher status
what they would have done for punishment. Failing to give the other 
immortal all the details of the crime will result in a far worse punishment
then what you already may be in. 
 
Most of the rules are not clearly defined and require common sense, if your
not sure how to interpret a rule ask an imm. All rules are made for a reason.
 
Not knowing a law is NO excuse, you should already know all the rules from
going through the Pre-Auth-Station. The most common punishment is being sent
to hell. Some punishments could be as large as being banned from the mud.

65 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.
 
It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value 
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

65 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>
 
LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.
 
If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.
 
So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.
 
If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.
 
See FORCE
~

55 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

50 MAPEDIT~
Syntax: mapedit
Syntax: mapedit sector <type>
Syntax: mapedit save <mapname>

The mapedit command is used to make changes to the overland map system.
It's a fairly involved portion of the OLC code as a whole, but is not
terribly difficult to use.

Typing 'mapedit' with no other arguments toggles your editor on or off.
When on, any movement you make will change the sector you're moving to
into whatever you have yourself set for. Think of it as "painting".

To set yourself to create a sector, simply type 'mapedit sector <type>' 
where the type is something from the sectortypes list. Also note that
while you are in edit mode, typing 'look' will cause the sector you are
in to be changed.

To save changes to a map, type 'mapedit save <mapname>'. If you leave out
the mapname, the map you are currently on will be the one saved.

For details on using the floodfill option, see 'help floodfill'.

For details on manipulating exits on the map, see 'help setexit'.

weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.
 
&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

&CMutants are a strange and unique race. Even their individual members
are unique, often looking completely different from one another. All
mutants possess the ability to mutate their body further than they
already are, granting them abilities, and often making them stronger
or quicker as well. Some are able to mutate so much that they look
completely different from their original form. Rumor has it that
there have been members of the Ginyu Force that were mutants.

&CMutants, as they gain in power, eventually earn the ability
to mutate into a new form, granting themselves tremendous power,
strength, and sometimes even speed. Because of the diverse appearance
of the mutant race, and the unpredictable nature of their mutations,
it is impossible to describe these forms.  More often than not,
each mutant has forms unique to itself.

&YSyntax: &RMystic SSJ &C- toggles mystic ssj status

Using Dai Kaio-shin's special techniques, which involve various honing
methods meant to train the warrior to channel tremendous amounts of ki,
a halfbreed warrior may experience a tremendous increase in power, speed,
and battle prowess. This is similar to the Super Saiyan powerup, but
without the anger and emotions. Much like some martial arts, the learning
of the Mystic technique changes the attitude and mental stability of the
warrior. Though the use of mystic will not inherently make an evil person
into a virtuous one, it does tend to calm some of the more savage
characteristics that emerge in someone with only partial saiyan blood.

yet you know that your jouney has only just begun.

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

1 NAME NAMES~
&YHelp Topic&O:&B Choosing Your Name
&YRelated Topics&O:&B (None)
 
&RSyntax&r:&C Name [Newname]
 
&RUsage&r:&CThis command allows a pre-authorization player to change their
name to a new one if their original choice has been denied.
Example: A new player named Pete has his name denied. To change his
name to 'Joe', Pete would simply type:&Y Name Joe&W.
 
&CWhen first creating a character in DBZW:B, it is best to choose a name
that is unique, simple and sensible. Remember, your name will help
to define who you are in the universe, and will how people think
of you.
 
Some of guidelines of what you should &Rnot&C choose:
 
&c - No names from DB, DBZ or DBGT or any names judged to
be too closely related.
- Nonsensical, unpronounceable or ridiculous.
- Profane or derogatory as interpreted in any language.
- Futuristic names or technical, such as "Laser" or "Circuit."
- Similar to that of any Realms Immortal, major mob, or equipment.
- Significant in history, mythology, or any religion.
- Comprised of various capital letters, such as 'BrACkkA' or 'CORTO'.
- Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
- Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives,
as in 'Heart', 'Big', 'Flying', 'Broken', 'Slick' or 'Tricky'.
- Any of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Jade as 'Edaj'.
- Any combination of singular descriptive nouns/adverbs or adjectives, as
in 'Metaljacket Heartbound Earthstone or Softheart'.
- No Number names (ie. roman numerals, numbers spelled out)
- No names that are used by mobiles used on the mud.
 
&CWe do recognize that some of the names that could possibly exist in the
DBZ world are somewhat eccentric, and the Immortals might choose
to make some allowances. Please note, however, that the names in
the series are for the most part VARIATIONS of certain objects/names/food,
and not the actual names themselves.
 
Just because you had a name in the past does not mean it will pass
again. Each IMM has his own reasons for allowing names they do, and
those reasons are not for mortals to complain about.

49 NAME2~
&YSyntax:  name <newname>
&W
This command allows a pre-authorization player to change their name to
a new one if their original choice has been denied.
  Example: A new player named Pete has his name denied. To change his
  name to 'Joe', Pete would simply type: &YName Joe&W.
 
When choosing a name, please try to choose one which is both medieval
and unique. Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge
an identity for yourself. Simply put, your name should &YNOT &Wbe:&G
 - Nonsensical, unpronounceable or ridiculous.
 - Profane or derogatory as interpreted in any language.
 - Futuristic or common, such as 'Jill' or 'Laser'.

 - Comprised of various capital letters, such as 'BrACkkA' or 'CORTO'.

Please keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines
which all immortals follow. In addition, they may have their own
reasons for denying your name. The final determination as to the
validity of a name on the Realms is the discretion of the Immortals
and is NOT subject to debate or discussion. If your name is denied,
simply follow the guidelines and try a new one.

&CNameks are a strange alien race from a planet of the same name. They
have green skin, with sections of pink, ribbed flesh on their arms
and legs. They tend to be peaceful, and above all, very wise. Their
abilities are diverse, ranging from healing those who have been
injured, to extending limbs to attack from a distance. They can
regenerate these limbs if they are severed, and are even rumored
to be the originators of the dragonballs. Despite their peaceful
tendencies, they are strangely suited to the arts of war, given
their many abilities, and some of their race do indeed take
advantage of this.

~

49 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

1 PASSWORD~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

1 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

When putting color in something, please try to remember to close your
colors with a &&D tag so that anyone viewing it won't have to deal with
color bleeding all over the place. The same holds for italic or underlined
text as well.

The &&d tag should only be used when absolutely necessary.

Background color tag: ^^
Tokens for background color are:

^^x - Black         ^^r - Red           ^^g - Green
^^O - Orange        ^^b - Blue          ^^p - Purple
^^c - Cyan          ^^w - Grey

If setting both foreground and background colors. The foreground must
be used before the background color. Also, the last color setting in your
prompt will wash over into the text you type. So, if you want a set
of colors for your typed text, include that at the end of your prompt set.
 
Example (assuming current h.p.'s of 43 and mana of 23): 
 
Prompt &&Y^^b<%h/&&x^^r%m>&&w^^x = <43/23>
        {A}     {B}       {C}

A) Yellow with blue background.

&YHelp Topic&O: &BPL POWERLEVEL
&YRelated Topics&O: &BPowerup Ki
 
&CPl is short for powerlevel. Powerlevel is basically the experience points
on this system. The higher the pl the more powerful you are. Pl accounts
for alot of things. It determines how much damage you give and receive,
it determines the chances of you dodging, and also determines (along
with your %) how well you can hit with a skill. 
 
To gain more pl you simply fight mobs. With each hit on a mob you gain
a small amount of PL.

&CAll races have the ability to powerup, boosting their powerlevel. While
in this way, you will take less damage, be more likely to dodge, and even
hit more often. Please note that you may not count your maxpl (that which
you have while powered up), when trying to learn skills. For example, to
learn kick or punch, you must have 5000 PL before powering up. Most races
have other ways to increase their max pl. Check your racial file for info
on this. Powerup and racial forms do not work together, if you use a racial
form, powerup will not further increase your PL. You start with the ability
to powerup once, and gain additional powerups when your PL reaches certain
points. It's up to you to find what Pl gains a new powerup

attempt it. Once a skill has been practiced, further learning may only
be obtained through repeated use. There is a formula for determining

Primary Attack is an attack done by other races, which a biodroid, through
his cells can learn it. Here are the known Primary Attacks:
     &Y*&CMasenko:
     Some biodroids have gained the knowledge of Gohan's special attack,
     the masenko. It doesnt do that much damage but it can be quick.
     &Y*&CTribeam:
     Another known technique is Tribeam. This technique, used by the famous
     human, Tien. Is a technique which focuses on gathering power in a simple
     triangle that is formed with the hands.
     &Y*&CScattershot:
     This attack is commonly used by nameks and mutants. Its an attack which
     launches many small beams towards its victim, hoping that more than one
     of them will make contact.
     &Y*&CMentalthrow:
     The deadliest and the rarest primary attack is this one... Mental Throw.
     Its an attack that is learned from the icers and it focuses on psychic
     energy to throw huge objects at the victim.

&RSyntax: &CPunch (while in Battle) - Punches an Opponent

The most basic attack available to any race is that of the punch.
Children perfect this maneuver long before they are ever engaged in
any sort of real conflict. However, this skill does not reflect the
basic punch that is so much a part of our everyday lives. Rather,
this is a quick, but powerful punch, tailored to inflict an extra
blow on an opponent without slowing down your normal attacks.

Since they focus so much on martial arts, rather than energy attacks,
humans are often able to hit an opponent twice and still not delay
their other attacks. One example of the doublepunch is a spinning
attack that allowes oneself to hit an opponent twice without jeopardizing
their other attacks.

49 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it

You will be attacked.  You do not need to be warned, let's face it, if I
was standing on the street with you, I'd wait for you to die, and then
beat the crap out of you.  Just remember the person's face, and get back
at them later! 

&Y-&W A fight is over when you leave the area. Entering ships to rebean or to heal
is illegal and you shall be punished if caught doing so. &Y(&Rthis also includes
hiding beans on the asteroid&Y)

&Y-&W You must give someone who has just finished fighting 5 minutes before
attacking that person. This will give that person time to prepare.

57 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

65 SETCLAN~
Usage: setclan <clan> <field> <deity|leader|number1|number2> <player>
Field being one of:
 deity leader number1 number2
 members board recall storage guard1 guard2
 align (not functional) memlimit obj1 obj2 obj3 obj4 obj5

~

62 SETEXIT~
Syntax: setexit create
Syntax: setexit delete
Syntax: setexit <vnum>
Syntax: setexit map <mapname> <X-coord> <Y-coord>

The setexit command allows you to manipulate exits from the overland
to rooms or other maps. The command is fairly straightforward.

To create a new exit, simply type 'setexit create' while standing on
your overland map.

To delete an existing exit, simply type 'setexit delete' while standing
on the coordinates of the exit sector. You will probably need to use the
'coords' command to move onto the exit sector.

To set an exit from the map into a regular zone, type
'setexit <vnum>' where vnum is the target room's vnum.

To set an exit from one map to another map, type
'setexit map <mapname> <X> <Y>' where mapname is the name you gave to
the target map, x is the target x coordinate, and y is the target y
coordinate.

Any manipulation of an exit automatically saves the entrances.dat file
to disk, so there is no need to worry about saving that file.

~

63 SETMARK~
Syntax: setmark add
Syntax: setmark delete
Syntax: setmark desc <destription>
Syntax: setmark distance <distance>

Landmarks are the points on the overland maps that the survey command uses
to display its information to players. The data is stored in a simple text
file in the directory with the ANSI maps.

To add a landmark, go to the coordinates you want it to be at and simply
type: setmark add

To remove one, go to the coordinates it is at and simply type:
setmark delete

The description is just a short line of text to describe what the survey
command sees. When editing the description, keep it as short as possible,
do not capitalize words unless referring to names, and do not add punctuation
to the end of the line. To change the description, go to the landmark
coordinates and type: setmark desc <text>, Where <text> is the
description you want.

Distance is the number of spaces the landmark is visible from on the overland.
Try not to make the distance too large, or too small. Anything visible for
more than 50 or so spaces is most likely too large - unless the landmark is
intended to display a large geographical feature such as a mountain.

To see the existing list of landmarks and their locations, type: landmarks

No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be

        &Rssj &C- revert back to your normal state
 
Saiyans and half-breeds possess the ability to transform into a form known
as that of a Super Saiyan. This form is actually divided into four stages,
known simply as SSJ, SSJ2, SSJ3, and SSJ4. Though all those with any saiyan 
blood at all may attempt this transformation, only those that are truly 
powerful will survive the process. When a saiyan or half-breed turns into a 
Super Saiyan, they are surrounded by a glowing golden ki energy. In addition,
their hair often grows long and yellow. Rumors persist that there are ways
of identifying someone who has achieved a higher form of Super Saiyan,
but one would have to find out for oneself. And that might be dangerous.
 
It is impossible for a half-breed to achieve SSJ3, no matter how hard
they may train. Also, it is important to know that the first time one
transforms into any given level of Super Saiyan, it must be triggered

1 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

&CIcers have the ability to transform in different stages or forms. As they gain in power th

&cStage 1: &CThis is the stage an icer is when is born: they spend the most
of their time in this form, being the easiest to maintain, and often
causing their opponents to underestimate them. On this form they are tiny,
with small muscles, and small black spikes protruding from their heads
and body.

&cStage 2: &CAll icers are able to transform into a second form, far more
fearsome than their original form. This creature has tremendous muscle
mass, but hardly loses any speed at all. The increased muscle mass of this
form gives it a good boost to stre ngth while not hindering its speed in
the slightest.

&cStage 3: &CWhen an icer reaches this form, they have gone as far as most
icers will ever go. Though its a bit smaller than the previous, its
muscles are much more compact, allowing it to be even stronger than the
previous form. Thanks to the less size and greater strength, this form is
also faster than the previous two stages allowing them to move faster.

&cStage 4: &CThis form is the smallest of the forms, even smaller than the
first stage. The compact muscles and the tiny size of this form gives it
an a larger boost in speed while not losing any strength from the previous
form making it more deadly.

&cStage 5: &CThe final form of the icers race. Identical to the previous
form, but with heightened intelligence, speed and power. Those who have
achieved their fifth form demonstrate great endurance in battle and
determination to succeed in any battle.

&cMetal: &CThe Ultimate form of the icers race. Their skin turns to a
metal-like form. Their entire body is one ultimate body armor that powers
up their strength and defense.

Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.

Syntax: users <host ip>

Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.
 
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

1 WEAPONS~
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.

49 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all the immortal commands.

49 WIZINVIS~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
 - Immortals level 49 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.
 
 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 49 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 49 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 49 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.
 
The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.
